Exercise 45 - Word Finder
There will be times when you'll need to read in one FILE, modify it, and then write a modified version of that

Challenges
Modify the program to track the number of replacements and report that to the screen when the program finishes.
Create a configuration FILE that maps “bad” words to “good” words and use this FILE instead of a hard-coded value.
Modify the program so that it can handle every FILE in a folder of FILEs instead of a single FILE.
